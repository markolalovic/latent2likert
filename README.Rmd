The purpose of this package is to provide an easy way to simulate and analyse Likert-type responses.

* It allows users to generate symmetrically or asymmetrically distributed responses to Likert-scale items using optimal discretization of a normal or skew-normal distribution.

* The relationship between a continuous latent distribution and ordinal Likert responses is maintained during this process. Staying within the framework of the classical theory's assumptions regarding the treatment of Likert-type responses.

* It implements the approach to convert the ordinal Likert responses to possible latent values assuming that the latent distribution is normal or skew-normal distribution. 

* Given actual responses to the Likert-scale survey questionnaire, this can be utilized by the researcher to estimate not only the values of a particular population, but also how they differ among different populations.

* The use of classical statistical methods is enabled without arbitrary mapping of responses to numbers.

## Installation
You can install the latest version using `devtools`:
```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages("devtools")
library(devtools)
```

Then install `responsesR` using:
```{r eval=FALSE}
install_github("markolalovic/responsesR")
library(responsesR)
```

```{r, include = FALSE}
setwd("/home/marko/repos/responsesR/R/")
set.seed(12345)
source("responses.R")
library(corrplot)
```

# Quick Start
To generate a sample of 100 observations for 10 Likert scale items, run
```{r}
df <- genLikert(size = 100, items = 10)
```
The result is a data frame of simulated responses where rows correspond to observations and columns correspond to Likert scale items:
```{r}
head(df)
```

```{r fig.width=15, out.width="100%", dpi=300}
par(mfrow=c(2, 5))
for(i in 1:10) {
  barplot(table(df[, i]))
}
```

## Correlation
By default, a correlation matrix is generated randomly, which means that the correlations between pairs of responses to individual items are random:
```{r out.width="50%", dpi=300}
par(mfrow=c(1, 1))
corrplot(corr=cor(df))
```

In order to set a specific correlation between pairs of items, for example 0.5, use:
```{r out.width="50%", dpi=300}
df <- genLikert(size = 100, items = 10, correlation = 0.5)
corrplot(corr=cor(df))
```

You can also provide a correlation matrix. For example, a 3 by 3 correlation matrix:
```{r}
R <- c(1.00, -0.63, -0.39, -0.63, 1.00, 0.41, -0.39, 0.41, 1.00)
R <- matrix(R, nrow=3)
R
```
And use it for 3 Likert scale items:
```{r out.width="50%", dpi=300}
set.seed(12345)
df <- genLikert(size = 100, items = 3, correlation = R)
corrplot(corr=cor(df), method = "number")
```

## Levels
By default, the `genLikert` function uses a 5-point Likert scale. To change the number of possible responses use the "levels" parameter. For example, for a 10-point Likert scale use:
```{r fig.height=5, dpi=300}
df <- genLikert(size = 1000, items = 1, levels = 10)
barplot(table(df))
```


You can use a levels vector to generate responses for different point scales. For example, to generate responses to 3 Likert scale items with 2, 4, and 10-point Likert scales, use:
```{r fig.height=2.5, dpi=300}
df <- genLikert(size = 1000, items = 3, levels = c(2, 4, 10))
par(mfrow=c(1, 3))
for(i in 1:3) {
  barplot(table(df[, i]))
}
```

## Location, scale and shape parameters
By default, the function `genLikert` uses a standard normal latent distribution and generates symmetrically distributed responses. This can be observed by increasing the sample size and number of levels:
```{r, dpi=300}
df <- genLikert(size = 10^6, levels = 100)
par(mfrow=c(1, 1))
barplot(table(df)/10^6)
```

Introducing asymmetries and changing the properties of hypothetical survey respondents can be achieved by utilizing parameters `location`, `scale`, and `shape`.

You can use a location vector to generate responses from latent distributions with different means. As an example, let's use the means -1, 0, and 1:
```{r fig.height=2.5, dpi=300}
df <- genLikert(size = 1000, items = 3, location = c(-1, 0, 1))
par(mfrow=c(1, 3))
for(i in 1:3) {
  barplot(table(df[, i]))
}
```

The scale vector is used to change the variances of latent distributions:
```{r fig.height=2.5, dpi=300}
df <- genLikert(size = 1000, items = 3, scale = c(0.5, 1, 1.5))
par(mfrow=c(1, 3))
for(i in 1:3) {
  barplot(table(df[, i]))
}
```

Finally, the shape parameter can be used to introduce response bias or skewness:
```{r fig.height=2.5, dpi=300}
df <- genLikert(size = 1000, items = 3, shape = c(-5, 0, 5))
par(mfrow=c(1, 3))
for(i in 1:3) {
  barplot(table(df[, i]))
}
```

When `shape != 0`, the function `genLikert` uses a skew-normal distribution. This can be observed by increasing the sample size and number of levels:
```{r fig.height=5, dpi=300}
df <- genLikert(size = 10^6, levels = 100, shape = -5)
par(mfrow=c(1, 1))
barplot(table(df)/10^6)
```

## Estimating the parameters of the latent population distribution
This will be added shortly.
