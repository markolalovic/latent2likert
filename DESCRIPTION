Description: Provides an easy framework to simulate survey data commonly
    analyzed in applied social research, specifically Likert items. Users
    can specify latent variables by providing means, standard deviations,
    and optionally, skewness and correlations. The generated dataset
    represents responses to Likert scale questions, which can be used for
    various purposes, such as validating theoretical findings obtained
    through factor analysis and structural equation modeling.  The package
    also allows for the estimation of parameters from existing survey data
    to replicate it more accurately.
