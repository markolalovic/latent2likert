Description: Simulates data sets that mimic the kind of survey data 
    commonly analyzed in applied social research known as Likert items. The user
    can leverage continuous variables with known means and covariance structure, 
    which undergo discretization into discrete variables. The discrete variables 
    mirror the original continuous data through Lloydâ€™s algorithm, a technique 
    commonly utilized in signal processing and closely linked to k-means clustering. 
    Furthermore, asymmetry can be introduced by incorporating skew normal distribution. 
    Additionally, the package enables the reconstruction of continuous variables from 
    probability distributions of discrete variables, thereby enabling users to replicate
    existing survey data more accurately.
